Therefore, determine error propagation CENTURY model turn much simpler Monte Carlo numerical approach, consists feeding model input parameters interests vary randomly model run following given distribution known mean variance. sake simplicity demonstrate perform uncertainty propagation analysis soil texture (.e. clay, silt sand) , keeping parameters model fixed. case, model run draw random proportion values three parameters, calculate CENTURY model values save output. done many times derive reliable confidence intervals output.
